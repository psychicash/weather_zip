converts a zipcode to lat/long coords then pulls current weather data from the governments weather api

zip to lat long performed via googles geocoding api
https://rapidapi.com/googlecloud/api/google-maps-geocoding

weather api located here
https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api

the google api requires a key which can be setup at the link above. 
I'm not sharing mine here because it is only free for the first 500 uses per month. so the key is kept in a seperate file.
